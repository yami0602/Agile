// Challenge 17
// Create a variable called loopNumbers and initialize it to an empty object literal. Using a for loop, iterate through nestedArr from the previous challenge.  For each iteration of your loop, assign a new property to loopNumbers where the property name is the first element in each nested array in nestedArr and the value is the second element.
