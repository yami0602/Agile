// Challenge 16
// You are provided with an empty array called nestedArr.  Using a for loop, add 5 sub-arrays to nestedArr, with each nested array containing the string 'loop' concatenated with the corresponding index in nestedArr as it's first element, and just the index as it's second element. Example of a subarray: ['loop3', 3]
